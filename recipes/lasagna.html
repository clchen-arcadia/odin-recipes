        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This beloved Italian recipe is an obsession for some, a vice for a few, and a comfort food for all. It is made by layering cooked sheets of pasta with alternating layers of meat sauce and cheese.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will want to begin this recipe with some extra time to spare, as you must cook each component separately before assembling the final product and baking it for another hour. But you will thank yourself for the trouble as lasagna is a special treat on its own and a wow-factor centerpiece on a special occasion.
